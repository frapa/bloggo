The thermodynamic potentials are quantities used in thermodynamics and chemistry.
They include and derive from the internal energy U of a system. But let's have a
little bit of introduction first!

#### Thermodynamics and state variables

Thermodynamics is all about systems, but what is a system? A (thermodynamical) system is
something macroscopic we want to study thermodynamically: the atmosphere, a fridge, a bottle of lemonade,
a living being, or a boring cilinder with a piston.

I would like to highlight two things:

 * A system can be just anything you want (*Wikipedia* defines it as a "precisely specified region of the universe"!).
 * In thermodynamics a system is something **macroscopic**, we do not deal with particles or system made up of
    just a little number of particles.
