Today I decided to start this blog as a place to share some brief thoughts
and projects. Every serious blog has a topic and a message to carry. This blog will
not be narrowly focused on a single topic, but I hope to write about:

 * Environment
 * Lifestyle and society
 * Science IT and technology

These may seem very different topics, but as I see them, they are stictly connected.
Lifestyle has a direct connection to environmental problems and solutions. Technology
and science is deeply tied to lifestyle, society and environment. Information Technology is
my passion and, through Free Software, I believe it represent a model for our future.

The **message** that I want to convey here is that we need to move towards a new kind
of society, in which we can live better, consume and pollute less. We can add more
joy and meaning to our lives building things ourselves instead of buying everithing pre-made
or by enjoying our awesome planet without killing it. We can get rid of stess by
slowing down the pace, while getting more time to spend with friends and family.

If I had to choose a word to represent the message of the blog I would choose **slow**.
Less is more. Magic happens when you take this message seriously.

More about this soon!
